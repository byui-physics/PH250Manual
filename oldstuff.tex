FROM THE OLD INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS

Last week we tackled very simple computer control, but we said we also want
to transfer data from our experiment to our computer. In order to understand
how to do that, we need to know what things we can measure with electronic
devices. We will take on this question today, but we will get practice
making these measurements with special equipment designed just for making
these measurements. These devices won't send the data they measure to our
computers, but they will display it so we can see the data.
