Changes made for Winter 2022:

* Reordering some of the material.
* Including a soldering lab.
* Adding objectives at the beginning of each chapter.
* Reducing the amount of E&M theory (they should be getting that in class now).
* Labeling and referencing all figures.
* Edits for clarity and concision.
