	* PH250_Lab_Manual_1.0.tex: added self to list of authors, included
	macros.tex file to provide objectives boxes and items to review boxes.
	Also using package xcolor with option dvipsnames.

	* macros.tex: new file. Defines macros for objectives boxes and 
	items to review boxes, among other things.

	* Chapters/Intro_Arduino_ComputerControl.tex: Changed the name of the
	chapter (shortened) so it fits in the page headers.

	* Chapters/Intro_Arduino_ComputerControl.tex: Added list of
	objectives, items to review, and labeled/captioned/referenced all
	figures. Also commented out the exercises where the arduino produced
	lights blinking in the Fibonacci sequence, and inserted a discussion
	on soldering. (I figured this was a good place for that discussion,
	along with learning about breadboards.) Finally, I've edited the text
	for clarity, brevity, and reducing the details on the physics that
	they will have already learned in PH220/PH223 during the first block.
